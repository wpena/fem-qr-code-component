## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-respinsive

### What I learned

I learnt that when creating a box-shadow in CSS, the first value is for offset-x (Left (Negative value to offset left) or Right (Positive value to offset right)) and the second value is for offest-y (Up (Negative value to offset up and) or Down (Positive value to offset down)). The third value is to add a blur and fourth value is for spread (How big you want the shadow to be), and finally followed by a color. I used rgba to give it a color and opacity. The 'a' is for alpha which controls the opacity.

Example: 
```css
.card-body {
  box-shadow: 0 25px 25px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05);
}
```

### Useful resources

- [FreeCodeCamp Resource](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/css-box-shadow-property-with-examples/) - This helped me understand how box-shadows work and how to use them.
